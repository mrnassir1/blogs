Setting Goals That Are Way Too Big\n\nWe've all made these crazy plans. You decide you're going to:\n\n- Learn a whole new language in three months\n- Start a multi-million riyal business overnight\n- Transform your body in one week\n\nReality check: These goals are impossible to tackle all at once. They're just too massive.\n\n### 2. The Procrastination Problem\n\nProcrastination isn't about being lazy. It's about feeling overwhelmed. When a goal seems impossible, your brain hits the pause button. Suddenly, cleaning your room or scrolling through social media feels way more appealing than facing that big, scary goal.\n\n## How to Achieve Your Goals\n\n### Make Your Goals Super Small\n\nHere's a game-changer: Start so small that it feels almost ridiculous not to do it.\n\n- Want to get fit? Start with 10-minute walks\n- Hoping to write a book? Begin with 100 words a day\n- Dreaming of learning a language? Learn three new words daily\n\n### Goal-Setting Plan\n\n- Start small\n- Keep it simple\n- Make it incredibly easy\n- Celebrate every tiny win\n\n## The Real Secret\n\n> \"Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.\"\n> - Robert Collier, 1885\n\n**Are you ready to turn your dreams into reality?**",
